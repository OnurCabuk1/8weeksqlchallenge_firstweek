 8-Week SQL Challenge: Week 1 Completed! 🎉

I completed the 1st week of the #8WeekSQLChallenge series, which I started to improve my SQL skills. 📊

During this week:
✅ I improved my SQL query skills by working on the Danny's Diner scenario.
✅ I learned basic SQL techniques for data analytics: table joins, group-based analysis, and the basics of window functions.
✅ I simulated data-driven decision-making processes by working on real-world problems.

This challenge both strengthened my technical knowledge and helped me improve my analytical thinking skills. 💡

I'm looking forward to the remaining weeks of my SQL learning journey! 🚀


Thank you @Danny Ma and the #8WeekSQLChallenge community!
